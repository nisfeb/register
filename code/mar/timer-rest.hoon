::  timer-rest: poke to cancel a timer previously set with %timer-set
::
::  Sample is named `rest`, NOT `wire`: a top-level `=wire` sample face
::  shadows the kernel `wire` type, so `,wire` in +grab resolves to the
::  sample leg and +build-vale (marks.hoon slap of noun:grab) crashes
::  -find.$. Mirrors %timer-set, whose sample is `req` for the same
::  reason. (Fix from nisfeb's PR #41, commit 15df8b2.)

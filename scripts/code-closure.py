"""Is this code directory closed under everything a GUEST resolves?

A published app is hermetic twice over. desk.hoon: "The host layer resolves
marcs from the root code namespace; the guest resolves against /desk/code.
Guests distribute every marc they use." And +find-code-ns is hermetic for
source: "Lower namespaces must include marks/libs they need."

So unlike the host-world checks, this one resolves MARCS as well as imports.
A marc `[/dir %name]` is mar/dir/name.hoon; `[/ %name]` is mar/name.hoon.

  code-closure.py <code-dir> [--fill <grubbery-desk>]

Without --fill it reports. With it, it copies each missing marc/lib in from
a grubbery desk and repeats until closed, because a vendored marc drags in
its own imports.

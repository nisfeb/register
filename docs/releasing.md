#  Releasing register: what makes ricsul update, and what makes its subscribers update

Register is a **stock desk app**: the source of truth is this git repo, the publisher is `~ricsul-bilwyt`, and every other ship gets it from ricsul. Two separate mechanisms move a change along that path, and they fail in different ways. This file is the same in nisfeb/lattice, nisfeb/auspex and nisfeb/calendar, because the mechanism is identical for all four and the thing that costs hours is not knowing which half you are looking at.

Written 2026-09-15 from the grubbery kernel source (`gub/nex/desk.hoon`) and from failures measured on `~ricsul-bilwyt`, `~martyr-sanryg` and `~wex` that day. Line references are to grubbery's `desk/gub/nex/desk.hoon`.

##  The short version

```
you: git push  (ref main)
  |
  |  ricsul's forge polls the remote every 15 min  (config.json "poll": 15)
  v
ricsul's forge repo         /apps/forge.git_forge/repos/register.git_repo/data/tree/code
  |
  |  ricsul's register.desk watches that tree's code/version.json
  |  and pulls when it DIFFERS from its own root version.json
  v
ricsul's desk               /apps/shell.shell/desks/register.desk/desk/code
  |
  |  ricsul REPUBLISHES the version file; subscribers watch that
  v
every subscriber's desk     source.json -> ~ricsul-bilwyt/apps/shell.shell/desks/register.desk/desk/code
```

**The single thing that makes anything update is `code/version.json` changing.** Not a new commit, not changed code: the version number. Everything below is detail on that one fact.

##  1. What makes ricsul update

Ricsul's forge repo tracks this repo. Its config:

```json
{"token":"","ref":"main","repo":"nisfeb/register","poll":15}
```

So a `git push` to `main` reaches ricsul **on its own within about 15 minutes**. There is no staging state for a desk app: pushing is deploying, on a timer.

To make it immediate instead of waiting for the poll:

```sh
POST https://urbit.sneagan.com/grubbery/forge/api/run
     {"repo":"register.git_repo","command":"pull"}
```

It answers `ok`, which means the forge accepted the command, **not** that the desk has rebuilt. The pull checks the repo out into the forge tree; the desk then has to notice.

Ricsul's register desk points at that tree:

```json
{"code":"/apps/forge.git_forge/repos/register.git_repo/data/tree/code"}
```

A local path, not a ship. Ricsul reads its own forge. (Subscribers point at ricsul over ames instead; see §2.)

##  2. What makes ricsul's subscribers update

Every subscriber's register desk has a `source.json` naming ricsul:

```json
{"code":"~ricsul-bilwyt/apps/shell.shell/desks/register.desk/desk/code"}
```

The desk nexus keeps a subscription on the source's `code/version.json` (desk.hoon:163-186). On a `%news` for that file it runs `do-snapshot` then `sync-release`. **No user action is required**: nobody has to press Fetch Latest, and no consent prompt appears unless the release adds a road to `ask.json`.

The gate is exactly this (`+source-behind`):

```hoon
(pure:m !=(src-ver own))
```

An inequality between the source's `code/version.json` and the desk's own root `version.json`. Nothing else is compared: not file hashes, not commit ids, not timestamps.

`sync-release` then mirrors the code tree and **republishes the version file locally**, with the kernel's own comment explaining why:

> mirror the source's version file locally, under its own name, so followers of THIS desk watch our republished version

That is the relay hop. It is why a subscriber can itself be a publisher.

##  3. Therefore: bump `code/version.json` on every release

| what you did | what happens |
|---|---|
| changed code, bumped version | ricsul syncs, subscribers sync. Correct. |
| changed code, **forgot** the bump | **nothing propagates.** Ricsul's forge has your commit; no desk ever pulls it. Everything looks fine and nothing shipped. |
| bumped version, no code change | the version file syncs and nothing else does. `sync-dir` is content-addressed: only real changes write, so no nexus rebuilds. |

The second row is the common mistake and it is silent. The third row matters when you are trying to force a rebuild: a version-only bump will not do it.

##  4. Verifying a release actually landed

Check all four, in this order. Each separates a different failure.

```sh
# 1. did the forge fetch?
GET /grubbery/ball/apps/forge.git_forge/repos/register.git_repo/data/tree/code/version.json?raw=1

# 2. did ricsul's desk mirror it?
GET /grubbery/ball/apps/shell.shell/desks/register.desk/desk/code/version.json?raw=1
GET /grubbery/ball/apps/shell.shell/desks/register.desk/version.json?raw=1

# 3. did the instance rebuild, or is it BANGed?
GET /grubbery/ball/apps/shell.shell/desks/register.desk/desk/data/register.register_app?info=1
#    bang: null  = healthy.  bang: "no built nexus %register--app ..." = dead.

# 4. does the route answer?
GET /apps/register        # fast 200/403 = alive.  hang = dead instance holding the route.
```

A version number is not proof. **The instance's `bang` is the proof**, and the route is the proof a user cares about.

##  5. The failure modes, all measured

###  5a. Version matches, code tree empty: wedged for ever

Measured on `~martyr-sanryg`, 2026-09-15. Its calendar desk read `{"version": 15}` at the root, ricsul published 15, and `code/` was **empty**: zero children. `source-behind` compared 15 to 15, answered "not behind", and never synced again. The desk page reported itself up to date. `/apps/register` hung for 30 seconds on every request.

The version gate is the trap: it suppresses the only thing that would refill the tree. The escape is the unconditional pull, which has no version gate:

```sh
POST /grubbery/desk/register/fetch-latest
```

(`+do-fetch`, desk.hoon: *"pull the source's current code now, unconditionally (no version gate)"*. The same thing runs from a `{"action":"fetch"}` poke at the desk's `main.sig`.)

###  5b. A BANGed instance is not healed by a successful sync

Same ship, same incident. After `fetch-latest` refilled the tree, `/nex/register/app.hoon` compiled cleanly in 11.8s, and the instance stayed BANGed. `reload-changed-nexuses` ran for 28ms and never visited it, because a nexus that never built has no recorded refs for a changed-refs walk to follow.

It came back only when the instance was reloaded explicitly. Over HTTP, that is a form-encoded POST to the instance's own explorer URL:

```sh
POST /grubbery/ball/apps/shell.shell/desks/register.desk/desk/data/register.register_app
     action=reload-nexus
```

So: **a clean compile does not imply a live app.** Check the bang.

###  5c. A neck-less `/desk/code` never compiles anything

A `/desk/code` that was created as a plain directory, by an older kernel, or by hand, has no `[/ %code]` neck, and a dir without that neck is not a code namespace, so grubbery never runs `build-code` over it. Files land with the right marks and nothing compiles them. The desk page says "nothing to pull" while the app is dead.

`+ensure-code-nexus` repairs it. It used to run only when the desk nexus rose, which a subscriber does not do by itself; since 2026-09-15 it also runs from `sync-release`, so an arriving release repairs it. Check the neck with:

```sh
GET /grubbery/ball/apps/shell.shell/desks/register.desk/desk?info=1
#    "code" child should have  neck: "/code"
```

###  5d. Symptom shapes

| symptom | usual cause |
|---|---|
| route **hangs** (no response, times out) | dead instance still holding the eyre binding |
| route **404s** | no instance bound at all |
| route **403s fast** | healthy; that is just unauthenticated |
| desk says up to date, app dead | 5a (empty tree) or 5c (neck-less dir) |

##  6. Desk apps and the kernel are delivered differently

Do not mix these up. Calendar, lattice, auspex and register are **desk apps**. Grubbery itself is the **kernel**.

| | desk app (calendar / lattice / auspex / register) | kernel (grubbery) |
|---|---|---|
| source of truth | this git repo | nisfeb/grubbery branch |
| how it reaches ricsul | `git push`, then forge poll or forge pull | `scp` to ricsul's mount, then `\|commit %grubbery` in the dojo |
| how it reaches subscribers | version bump, automatically | kiln desk sync, automatically |
| release unit | `code/version.json` | a clay commit |

Two notes on the kernel side, both learned the hard way:

- Touching `lib/*.hoon` or `app/grubbery.hoon` bumps the **gall agent**: the ship stops answering HTTP for minutes (~4.5 on `~wex`). Touching `gub/nex/*.hoon` only rebuilds a nexus, which is seconds.
- On ricsul, **deletions from the mount never reach clay**; adds and edits do.
- A `\|commit` that prints only `>=` with no rebuild means clay saw no change. That usually means it was already committed, not that the commit failed.

##  7. Testing before you ship

`~wex` is the fake test ship. Writing into a desk's code tree compiles **immediately**, with no commit, which is the fast loop:

```sh
POST /grubbery/ball/apps/shell.shell/desks/register.desk/desk/code/nex/register/app.hoon
     action=write-text  content=<the file>
```

Then read the instance's `?info=1`: `bang: null` means it compiled, and a non-null bang **carries the compile error with line and column**. That is about a minute per iteration. A file that does not exist yet needs `action=create-file&filename=<name>` first. `write-text` 404s on a missing file.

Fake ships derive every keypair from the `@p`, so anything key-dependent behaves differently there than on a real ship. Verify crypto paths on ricsul, not only on wex.

##  8. Register's own release checklist

1. `code/version.json` bumped, the number one higher than the last release.
2. `python3 scripts/code-closure.py code` reports nothing missing.
3. Unit tests green on `~wex`: `-test /~wex/grubbery/<rev>/tests/lib/register ~`.
4. `python3 scripts/api-matrix.py http://localhost:8080 /tmp/wex.cookies` prints `ALL OK`, twice in a row.
5. `python3 scripts/page-smoke.py http://localhost:8080` prints `ALL OK`.
6. Open `/apps/register/` on `~wex` in a browser without the cookie: the landing, the form, a draft that says Saved, submit, sign, pay, the manage page.
7. `git push origin main`, then on `~wex`: `POST /grubbery/forge/api/run {"repo":"register.git_repo","command":"pull"}`, and within a minute the desk's root `version.json` reads the new number and the instance's `bang` is `null`.
8. The event ship's steps are sneagan's.
